1. Document any known bugs.
None

2. Explain what changes you would have to make to turn your Actor Critic algorithm into a REINFORCE algorithm.
I would remove my critic NN and change the loss function.  For the loss function, I would only calculate the actor loss and replace "advantage" with rewards.  The optimizer would just optimize the loss for the actor NN.
